A Lua interpreter written entirely in C# for the .NET, Mono, Xamarin and Unity3D platforms.
It is 99% compatible with Lua 5.2 (with a few exceptions, like goto statements and hex floats) and includes some nifty addition, plus a tight integration with .NET code.

Please see http://www.moonsharp.org for downloads, infos, tutorials, etc.
