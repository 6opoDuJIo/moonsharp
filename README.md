MoonSharp
=========
http://www.moonsharp.org

A complete Lua solution written entirely in C# for the .NET, Mono and Unity3D platforms.

Includes an interpreter, debugger and will soon have code analysis facilities.

It is 99% compatible with Lua 5.2 (with the only know difference being weak tables support) and includes some nifty addition, plus a tight integration with .NET code.

Please see http://www.moonsharp.org for downloads, infos, tutorials, etc.
