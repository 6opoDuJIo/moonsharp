moonsharp
=========

An interpreter for a very close cousin of the Lua language, written entirely in C# for the .NET, Mono, Xamarin and Unity3D platforms.

*Project Status*
The project has just been started,  yet it is able to parse most Lua structures and execute them correctly. The code is,  however,  heavily unoptimized. 

*Roadmap*
* support for all core language structures (see documentation for differences between Moon# and Lua)
* optimizations 
* better integration between Lua/Moon# tables and CLR objects
* debugger embeddable in applications using Moon# 
* REPL interpreter
* standard library

*License*
The program and libraries are released under a BSD license - see the license section.
