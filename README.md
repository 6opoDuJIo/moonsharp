Moon# 
=========
http://www.moonsharp.org


An interpreter for a very close cousin of the Lua language, written entirely in C# for the .NET, Mono, Xamarin and Unity3D platforms.


**Project Status**

The project has just been started,  yet it is able to parse most Lua structures and execute them correctly. The code is,  however,  heavily unoptimized. 


**Roadmap**

* support for all core language structures (see documentation for differences between Moon# and Lua)
* optimizations 
* better integration between Lua/Moon# tables and CLR objects
* debugger embeddable in applications using Moon# 
* REPL interpreter
* standard library 

**Associated Resources**
